### Testing
For testing we used junit4. All testing files are located in the testing folder 
and can all be run just by running the main method in the TestRunner. This method 
outputs true when all tests are passed.

To test a single class the specific test(ClassName) files can be ran individually. These output nothing to the terminal.
If ran in Intellij the left panel will display all the indivial tests running successfully as well as the amount of time they took.
